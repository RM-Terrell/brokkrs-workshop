This repo is a workshop of sorts containing solutions to problems from around the web and in my own personal work that I found useful, interesting, infuriating, or all of the above. From famous algorithms like the bubble sort and binary tree inversions, to useful JavaScript .map() functions and other tricks.

The overall organization of this repo kind of throws organization to the wind. Theres a reason for that. Many types of algorithmic problems cross disciplinary boundaries. Theyre never just pure math, or pure one feature or another, nor should they be forced to be fore the sake of the organization of the repo. As such splitting by language is present for obvious reasons, along with some file name level organization, but other than that the main form of organization is through comments describing the problems and techniques used, **which can then be searched for**. Think of the comments like a search tag.
